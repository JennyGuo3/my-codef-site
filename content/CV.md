<h1 class="ba bw2 f1 mt3 mb1 b--blue">What is a CV? </h1> 

- A document that provides an overview of your skills, work experience and academic achievements.
- A CV is one to two pages long.
- A CV provides a snapshot of your academic and professional life for employers.


<h1 class="ba bw2 f1 mt3 mb1 b--blue">CV Structure</h1> 

- **Contact Details**: Phone number, professional email address and LinkedIn profile link. Do not include home address details.
- **Key Skills**: Mention any technical skills you may have (python, language skills etc)
- **Education**: University degree course, duration of degree, relevant modules, achieved/predicted grades and sixth form A-Level and GCSE Grades.
- **Work Experience**: Mention any internships, work experience that you have previously done relevant to the job position.
- **Extracurricular activities**: mention any societies, sports club, projects you have undertaken.
- **Achievements**: competitions, awards, academic performance.
- **Interests**: mention something that makes you unique beyond your professional career.
- **References**: mention one or two references who can vouch for your attributes, CV content and character.


<h1 class="ba bw2 f1 mt3 mb1 b--blue">How to write a good CV?</h1> 

**TIP ONE**
- Keep the CV to 1 page, max 2 pages. An employer spends an average of 8 seconds, if that, looking at a CV, so keep it concise and punchy.

**TIP TWO**
- Keep the font and font size consistent throughout the CV. The generic style is font size 12, Black, Arial/Calibri - avoid fancy font.

**TIP THREE**
- Clear structure and format - separate the content into paragraph and subheadings. If an employer cannot identify the content immediately, then it will be going to the trash pile.

**TIP FOUR**
- Tailor your CV to the employer - have a base template but do not send the same template to every single employer. 
- Research the company and look at the job description to know exactly what skills to point in your CV.

**TIP FIVE**
- Don’t just list your work experience or extra-curricular activities - provide a sentence or two explaining your role/skills you gained.

**TIP SIX**
- Don’t leave gaps in your CV - you may think you do not have any relevant experience, but you probably do without realising - have a think before proceeding!

**TIP SEVEN**
- No errors - check your CV for spelling, grammar and punctuation mistakes. Use a spellchecker!

**TIP EIGHT**
- Ask someone else to double-check your CV as employers do care about mistakes


<h1 class="ba bw2 f1 mt3 mb1 b--blue">How to write a CV with no work experience?</h1> 

1. Get **experience**! It is much easier than you think - it does not have to be some special hedge fund role or working for the UN.
2. **Volunteer** at a local charity shop/with charities.
3. Work at a **restaurant/cafe**.
4. **Retail** work experience - Primark, Debenhams etc.
5. **Political party** - volunteer with your local party to do runs, political activism etc.
6. **Local Banks** - some banks will accept younger students, just email them and ask politely about any opportunities they may have! HSBC offers sixth form work experience and a couple other banks also other similar opportunities - research them up and have a look.
7. **Tailor your CV** to focus on the skills the job requires, bring up academic experiences and group projects you have done.
8. **Show your personality** - mention achievements at school or your personal interests and hobbies.
9. A **strong cover letter** - to make up for your lack of work experience, you need to demonstrate your enthusiasm, capability and passion for the job.
