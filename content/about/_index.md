_First-hand student insight on how to secure internships and successfully navigate the application process_

Hi everyone! I'm Jenny and I am a first year Economics student at the University of Warwick. As the a first-generation student and the first in my family to attend University, I understand how daunting academic and professional decisions can be and the barriers in navigating the application process. 

As someone who spent the majority of their life doing 'trial and error' to find out what works best, I hope I can share my knowledge and experience to other fellow students in similar positions to also secure internships and offers.

I will be sharing insights into what makes a successful CV and cover letter, how to ace online tests and interviews, as well as assessment centres so you can secure that dream offer from your target firm!
